# A Meme Generator App
I built this project with React, took inspiration from a 12-hour Scrimba React course which I've done recently.
This project takes images from an API:
https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes
 I used: 
React, JavaScript (ES6+), CSS - Vite as a bundler and Node.js of course.
Here is a link to the website:
